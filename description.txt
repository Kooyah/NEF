Not Enough Flamethrowers (or NEF for short) adds onto the current lack of ingame flamethrowers by adding many unique variations, some obtainable as early as pre-hardmode.

This mod adds a total of 12 flamethrowers to the game so far, along with a handful of other unique guns. This mod is also subject to update, so stay tuned, and visit the forum page for more information and a discord link!
