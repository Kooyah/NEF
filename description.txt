Here's a great example of a "Thrown together in a few days" kind of mod. Not Enough Flamethrowers (or NEF for short) adds onto the current lack of ingame flamethrowers by adding many unique variations, some obtainable as early as the beggining of the game.

Not Enough Flamethrowers adds a total of 9 flamethrowers to the game so far. This mod is also subject to update, so stay tuned.
